# Deep learning homeworks
Repo for homeworks for the deep learning course at IST 2023/24.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

### HW1

Homework 1 was about Medical image classification with linear classifiers and neural networks. It was to be implemented using only numpy. There were also some theoretical questions

- `HW1/homework1.pdf`: This pdf file contains the assignment.

- `HW1/hw1-q1.py`: Contains code for Question 1, which covers classification with the perception, logistic regression, and the multi-layer perceptron, with implementation in numpy.

- `HW1/hw1-q2.py`: contains code for Question 2, which covers classification with logistic regression and the multi-layer perceptron, with implementation in torch.

- `HW1/report.pdf`: This pdf file contains the report for the project, detailing the methods used and the results obtained, as well as answers to the theoretical quetions.

### HW2

Homework 2 was about image classification with a CNN and automatic speech recognition, using the attention mechanism. There were also some theoretical questions

- `HW2/homework2.pdf`: This pdf file contains the assignment of HW 2.

- `HW2/data`:Subfolder with training data.

- `HW2/utils.py`: Utility functions for hw2-q2.py

- `HW2/hw2-q2.py`: Contains code for Question 2, which covers image classification using CNNs, with implementation in torch.

- `HW2/hw2-q3.ipnb`: Contains code for Question 3, which covers a sequence-to-sequence task using RNNs and attention, with implementation in torch.
  
- `HW2/report.pdf`: This pdf file contains the report for the project, detailing the methods used and the results obtained, as well as answers to the theoretical quetions.
